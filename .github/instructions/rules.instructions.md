Generate code that follows the principles of Clean Code, SOLID, and best development practices.

Ensure that:

The code is clear, readable, and maintainable.

Variable, function, and class names are expressive and self-explanatory.

SOLID principles are applied (single responsibility, open/closed, dependency inversion, etc.).

Duplication of logic is avoided, and reuse is encouraged through well-defined functions or classes.

Code is written considering the conventions of the technology/language (e.g., TypeScript, NestJS, React, Vue, MongoDB, etc.).

Include comments only when necessary, prioritizing code self-explanation.

Safe and efficient practices are considered (error handling, validation, strong typing, layering).

Optionally, add unit test examples if applicable.

Code and comments should be in English only. - For test titles, follow the pattern "when, it should".
- Do NOT use emojis.
- Do NOT generate explanatory documents unless explicitly stated otherwise.
